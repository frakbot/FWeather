FWeather
========
![Icon](/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

**FWeather** is a weather widget for Android based upon Tobias van Scheider's
[Authentic Weather](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Authentic-Weather/7196565) design.

This widget states the obvious and even invites you to look out of that bloody window
you've right in front of you.

Please be warned, this widget prominently uses cursing. If you don't like it,
just don't install the widget. The screenshots are censored, but the widget itself is not.

The permissions (coarse location, internet access) are requested to access your
coarse geolocation and to actually retrieve the weather at your location.
I don't collect any information, and as of version 1.0 your position is not even
stored locally. The app is open source, so you might just check out the code
if you don't trust my word! I've coded the widget in less than a day as a
learning experience for working with app widgets, so it's not really customizable
nor flexible (at the moment).

The widget supports [a few languages](#translating-fweather), but if you want
to contribute a translation you just have to issue a pull request
(remember to work on the develop branch!). Feedback is always welcome :)

You can also find FWeather on **[XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2346105)**!
